# Introduction

This is an API designed for sending SMS using java code. If you have list of users available along with their phone numbers ,you can use this API to send them msg iteratively.
The 160by2 service is way better than way2sms because it sends msg appended with small text (160by2.com) rather than loads of Add's in case of way2sms .
